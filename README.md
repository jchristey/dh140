# DH140: Coding for Humanities

## Jade Christey 

## Bio

I'm a senior Human Biology & Society major, Global Health and Digital Humanities minor from San Francisco. When I'm not in class I love playing rugby, cooking with my roommates and playing with my cat, Tofu. 

### Project Ideas & Class Objective 

Being a Human Bio & Society major I'm interested in all things health and wellness. One of the things that originally drew me to digital humanities was the way in which big data and health interact – this is especially relevant in the realm of digital health which I hope to explore more. In terms of bringing this data into a humanities context, I'm open to topics related to health equity and disease distribution among diverse groups. I'm also hoping to frame my research in a global context, using data from various countries and contexts to unlock truths regarding disease distribution.
